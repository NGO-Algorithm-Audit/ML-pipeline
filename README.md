## Project Overview

This project contains the data pipeline for training and testing a balanced random forest (BRF) model. This model is applied on:
- [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), 284.807 transactions with 0.172% fraud rate. Goal of this repository is to elaborate what sensitivity testing can be performed to strike a balance between precision and recall

### Methods used
-	Balanced Random Forest (BRF)
-   k-fold cross validation
-   Precision-Recall
-   Sensitivity testing
